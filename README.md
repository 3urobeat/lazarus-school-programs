# lazarus-school-programs  
Basic Lazarus programs we had to do in school. This repo is just for storing them.  
There were also other small programs but I decided to only put the programs up that got more attention by me.  

You are allowed to use the code in this repository if it can help you in any way.   
But I doubt that anyone actually really uses this language anymore.

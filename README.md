Basic Lazarus programs we had to do in school. This repo is just for storing them.  
There were also other small programs but I decided to only put the programs up that got more attention by me.  

Lazarus Version used in school: Version 1.0.12 (Date: 2013-08-24) - 32-bit version  

You are allowed to use the code in this repository if it can help you in any way.   
But I doubt that anyone actually really uses this language anymore.  
Just be advised that the projects could contain german language at some points.
